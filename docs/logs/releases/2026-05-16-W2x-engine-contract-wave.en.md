# W2.x Engine Contract Structural Wave — Release Note (v2.0.0-rc1)

> **Historical artifact frozen at SHA 0d73a3b (v2.0.0-rc3 + SPI integrity wave).** Baseline counts in this document (63 gate rules / 92 self-tests / 34 active engineering rules / 93 enforcer rows) reflect the corpus state at the W2.x release through rc3 and are NOT retroactively updated. The current canonical baseline (after the 2026-05-18 Beyond-SDD review response: 64 gate rules / 94 self-tests / 35 active engineering rules / 94 enforcer rows) is tracked in `docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml.architecture_sync_gate.allowed_claim` and `README.md`.

**Date:** 2026-05-16 (W2.x Phase 7 audit committed 18:36; v2.0.0-rc1 post-review hotfix committed evening)
**Driver review:** 2026-05-15 LucioIT L0 proposal *"Runtime-Engine Contract for Heterogeneous Agent Execution"* (`docs/reviews/2026-05-15-l0architecture-lucio It-wave-1-supplement-runtime-engine-contract.en.md`)

## Baseline counts (single canonical post-rc1)

These counts replace any earlier "Updated counts" addendum table; per post-release review §P1-1 the baseline is single-source. See the post-release response §4 for the rationale.

| metric | count |
|---|---|
| §4 constraints | 65 |
| Active ADRs | 77 |
| Active gate rules | 63 |
| Gate self-test cases | 92 |
| active engineering rules | 34 |
| Layer-0 governing principles | 13 |
| enforcer rows | 91 |
| Maven tests GREEN (under `mvn verify`) | 213 |
| Architecture graph | 246 nodes / 323 edges |

## Summary

The W2.x wave absorbs the 2026-05-15 L0 proposal in seven phases. **One new Layer-0 governing principle** (**P-M — Heterogeneous Engine Contract & Server-Sovereign Boundary**) operationalised by **six new Layer-1 rules** (43–48), backed by **seven new ADRs** (0071–0077), **six new gate rules** (55–60), and **fourteen new enforcers** (E74–E87).

The wave's central design choice is the **structural-downstreaming invariant** — every new domain contract ships as:
```
yaml schema  →  Java type that validates against the schema  →  runtime self-validate
```
**Rule 48 (Schema-First Domain Contracts)** makes this invariant permanent and gate-enforced beyond this wave. The invariant is the structural prevention of defect family F1 (text-form governance drift), which accounted for 79 of 158 historical closed defects (~50%).

## Four Competitive Pillars

Pillar coverage by canonical name (`performance`, `cost`, `developer_onboarding`, `governance` — matches `docs/governance/competitive-baselines.yaml`):

| Pillar | Baseline | W2.x impact |
|---|---|---|
| `performance` | latency / throughput | no regression; SyncOrchestrator dispatch is now O(1) lookup via `EngineRegistry.resolveByPayload` (was sealed-pattern switch) |
| `cost` | per-call + infra | no change |
| `developer_onboarding` | time-to-first-agent + surface complexity | improved — new engine integrations register a single `ExecutorAdapter`, no orchestrator patches required |
| `governance` | tenant isolation, audit, eval, safety | strengthened — engine envelope adds compile-time + runtime validation against `known_engines`; S2C callbacks declared in schema with mandatory propagation fields |

## ADRs landed (7)

- **ADR-0071** Engine Contract Structural Wave (umbrella; declares P-M, lists 0072–0077 as dependents)
- **ADR-0072** Engine Envelope + Strict Matching (Phase 1, Rules 43+44)
- **ADR-0073** Engine Lifecycle Hooks + Runtime-Owned Middleware SPI (Phase 2, Rule 45)
- **ADR-0074** Server-to-Client Capability Callback Protocol (Phase 3, Rule 46)
- **ADR-0075** Evolution Scope Boundary (Phase 4, Rule 47)
- **ADR-0076** R2 Pilot — Runtime Self-Validates the Engine Envelope (Phase 5)
- **ADR-0077** Schema-First Domain Contracts (Phase 6, Rule 48 cross-cutting)

## Rules landed (6 active L1 rules + 1 new L0 principle)

| Rule | Title | Phase | Gate rule | Enforcers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 43 | Engine Envelope Single Authority | 1 | 55 | E74, E76 |
| 44 | Strict Engine Matching | 1 | 56 | E75, E77 |
| 45 | Runtime-Owned Middleware via Engine Hooks | 2 | 57 | E78, E79, E80 |
| 46 | S2C Callback Envelope + Lifecycle Bound | 3 | 58 | E81, E82, E83 |
| 47 | Evolution Scope Default Boundary | 4 | 59 | E86, E87 |
| 48 | Schema-First Domain Contracts | 6 | 60 | E85 |
| — | (Phase 5 R2 pilot; no new rule) | 5 | — | E84 |

## Schemas landed (4)

- `docs/contracts/engine-envelope.v1.yaml` — engine metadata + payload routing
- `docs/contracts/engine-hooks.v1.yaml` — 9 canonical hook points + ordering
- `docs/contracts/s2c-callback.v1.yaml` — S2C request/response shape + 6 mandatory fields + outcome enum
- `docs/governance/evolution-scope.v1.yaml` — in/out evolution scope contract

## Java SPI surfaces added

- `ascend.springai.service.runtime.orchestration.spi`: `ExecutorAdapter`, `EngineMatchingException`, `HookPoint`, `HookContext`, `HookOutcome`, `RuntimeMiddleware`, `EngineHookSurface` (all pure `java.*` per E3)
- `ascend.springai.service.runtime.engine`: `EngineEnvelope`, `EngineRegistry`, `HookDispatcher`
- `ascend.springai.service.runtime.s2c`: `S2cCallbackEnvelope`, `S2cCallbackResponse`, `InMemoryS2cCallbackTransport`
- `ascend.springai.service.runtime.s2c.spi`: `S2cCallbackSignal`, `S2cCallbackTransport`
- `ascend.springai.service.runtime.evolution`: `EvolutionExport`
- `ascend.springai.service.runtime.resilience.SuspendReason.AwaitClientCallback` (new sealed variant)

## Cross-rule co-design audit (Phase 3a — hard gate before S2C code)

S2C touched the highest cross-cutting risk in the wave. The Phase 3a audit matrix in the response doctrine §5 named the resolution for **each of the 5 affected existing rules** (20 state machine, 35 channels, 38 no-sleep, 41 capacity, 42 sandbox) BEFORE any S2C code landed. Outcome: S2C absorbed without modifying any existing rule. Pattern reusable for future cross-cutting features.

## What's deferred

- **Runtime ResilienceContract integration for `s2c.client.callback` skill capacity** — declared in `skill-capacity.yaml`, runtime enforcement at SyncOrchestrator deferred to W2 per ADR-0074.
- **Production S2C transports** (webhook POST, SSE, WebSocket) — only `InMemoryS2cCallbackTransport` ships at W2.x; W3 scope.
- **Engine-side hooks** (LLM × 2, tool × 2, memory × 2) — only the 3 structural hooks (`on_error`, `before_suspension`, `before_resume`) fire from SyncOrchestrator at W2.x; engine-side firing lands in W2 Telemetry Vertical with the first consumer hooks.
- **RunEvent + EvolutionExport integration** — `EvolutionExport` enum + armed-empty ArchUnit ship at W2.x; W2 RunEvent variants will declare `evolutionExport()`.
- **Existing prose-enum retrofit** — 10 grandfathered entries in `gate/schema-first-grandfathered.txt` (RunStatus DFA, RunMode, deployment_plane, SuspendReason variants, RunScope, SkillKind, SkillTrustTier, JoinPolicy/ChildFailurePolicy, SemanticOntology, AdmissionDecision, BackpressureSignal, IdempotencyRecord CHECK). Retrofit scheduled per `CLAUDE-deferred.md` 48.b (W3).

## Verification (v2.0.0-rc2 canonical)

- `./mvnw clean verify` → 213 tests / 0 failures (146 agent-runtime + 67 agent-platform; see canonical baseline above)
- `bash gate/check_architecture_sync.sh` → GATE: PASS with 63 active gate rules (60 + Rules 61–63 added in v2.0.0-rc2)
- `bash gate/test_architecture_sync_gate.sh` → 92/92 self-tests PASS (86 + 6 added in v2.0.0-rc2 covering Rules 61/62/63 positive + negative)
- `python gate/build_architecture_graph.py` → 246 nodes / 323 edges (Phase 7 baseline; rc2 regenerates idempotently)
- `pwsh gate/check_architecture_sync.ps1` → exits 2 with `DEPRECATED` banner (v2.0.0-rc2: canonical-bash posture; PS entrypoint is fail-closed per second-pass review P0-1)

## Authority

- ADR-0071 (umbrella) authoritative
- L0 principle P-M operationalised by Rules 43–48
- W2.x doctrine response: `docs/reviews/2026-05-16-engine-contract-structural-response.en.md`
- Wave plan: `D:/.claude/plans/https-github-com-chaosxingxc-orion-spri-compressed-taco.md`

# Addendum — W2.x Phase 7 Audit Response (Superseded by §Baseline counts above — historical narrative only)

> **Supersession notice (v2.0.0-rc2, second-pass review P1-2):** every numeric and tag claim below this header is the Phase 7 *snapshot*, not the current rc2 baseline. The canonical numbers live in §Baseline counts and §Verification at the top of this release note. Where the historical text below disagrees with the top, the top wins. The Conclusion (`v2.0.0-w2x-final`) is retracted per the second-pass review.

**Audit plan:** `D:/.claude/plans/spi-atomic-willow.md`
**Trigger:** user request to audit conflicts between architecture declarations, engineering rules (CLAUDE.md), architecture decisions (ADRs), and SPI — and reflect on whether the corpus is L0-release-ready.
**Outcome:** **18 fixes landed across 7 parallel tracks; corpus is L0-release-ready.**

## Audit methodology — four-dimensional review

Four parallel Explore audits scanned:

1. **W2.x Engine Contract drift** — schema/yaml/code triplet completeness for all four W2.x contracts (engine-envelope, engine-hooks, s2c-callback, evolution-scope).
2. **L0 governance corpus integrity** — principle-coverage.yaml, enforcers.yaml, architecture-status.yaml, architecture-graph.yaml, posture-coverage.md, competitive-baselines.yaml, bus-channels.yaml, skill-capacity.yaml, sandbox-policies.yaml, evolution-scope.v1.yaml, SESSION-START-CONTEXT.md, all module-metadata.yaml, all ADRs 0068-0077.
3. **SPI / runtime code-truth** — agent-service/src/main, agent-service/src/test, agent-service/src/main pure-Java cross-package contamination, strict-match enforcement, hook surface presence, Run state machine integrity, async / blocking discipline, tenant scope, posture-aware defaults, test honesty.
4. **ADR corpus self-audit** (added after user pushback "少了个维度吧？ADR 的自检呢？") — front-matter discipline, supersedes/extends DAG integrity, decision↔rule↔enforcer triangle closure, decision body internal consistency, mutually consistent decisions across ADRs, orphan / dead references, ADR↔architecture-graph closure, status field truth, schema-first self-application.

**Findings:** 2 HARD (D1: ADR-0076 enforcer mis-citation; L-1: Rule 44 prose/code gap) + 12 SOFT. Self-inspection then mined 4 additional latent items (L-9 EngineEnvelope strict ctor, L-10 parent-Run propagation, L-11 ADR-0076 scope-creep watch, L-12 Phase 3a Matrix link-rot). Total: **18 findings**.

## Fixes landed (7 parallel tracks)

| Track | Scope | Files touched | Resolves |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | ADR cross-reference correctness | `docs/adr/0076-...yaml` (E81→E84); `docs/adr/0071-...yaml` (umbrella one_liner) | D1 (HARD) + D6 |
| **B** | Rule 44 compliance code fix | `agent-runtime/.../SyncOrchestrator.java` + new `EngineMismatchTransitionsRunToFailedIT.java` + `enforcers.yaml` E88 | L-1 (HARD) |
| **C** | Deferred-index sync | `docs/CLAUDE-deferred.md` (5 new entries: 44.b, 44.c, 46.b, 48.b, 48.c); `CLAUDE.md` listing | L-2, L-4, L-7, L-9 (via 48.c), L-10 (via 44.c) |
| **D** | Graph generator fix | `gate/build_architecture_graph.py` (emit `cross_cutting_invariant` edges + DO-NOT-EDIT header); regen → 242 nodes / 318 edges | D2, D3 |
| **E** | Advisory prose cleanup | `docs/governance/SESSION-START-CONTEXT.md` (reading order); `competitive-baselines.yaml` (release: W2.x Phase 7); `enforcers.yaml` E89 (Phase 3a Matrix freeze) | D4, D5, L-12 |
| **F** | Schema-first grandfather sunset | `gate/schema-first-grandfathered.txt` (pipe-delimited format with `sunset_date` per entry); `check_architecture_sync.sh` Rule 60 parser; `test_architecture_sync_gate.sh` (2 new self-tests); `CLAUDE.md` Rule 48 prose | L-6 (closes the "today's prose locked, yesterday's prose forever" asymmetry) |
| **G** | Hook surface clarification | `docs/adr/0073-...yaml` + `docs/contracts/engine-hooks.v1.yaml` (new `hook_ownership:` block distinguishing **runtime-fired** {on_error, before_suspension, before_resume} from **engine-fired** {6 LLM/tool/memory hooks}) | L-5 |

## Rule 44 compliance — the central code fix

The HARD semantic finding: Rule 44 declares "Mismatch raises `EngineMatchingException` **AND transitions the Run to FAILED with reason `engine_mismatch`**" — but `SyncOrchestrator.executeLoop()` only fired the `ON_ERROR` hook and rethrew, leaving the Run in its prior status. Rule 44 prose and code disagreed.

**Fix:** Inserted a specific `catch (EngineMatchingException eme)` branch **before** the generic `catch (RuntimeException e)` at SyncOrchestrator line 129. The branch:

1. Idempotent-guards `if (run.status() != RunStatus.FAILED)` then `run = runs.save(run.withStatus(RunStatus.FAILED).withFinishedAt(Instant.now()))` (Rule 20 DFA `RUNNING → FAILED` and `SUSPENDED → FAILED` both legal).
2. Fires `HookPoint.ON_ERROR` carrying `reason="engine_mismatch"` + `requestedEngineType` + `actualPayloadType` attributes.
3. Re-throws the original `EngineMatchingException` so the parent recursive frame still observes the failure.

**Verified by:** `EngineMismatchTransitionsRunToFailedIT.engine_mismatch_transitions_run_to_failed_and_fires_on_error_with_reason` (E88) — asserts the FAILED transition, finishedAt set, and `reason=engine_mismatch` in the captured ON_ERROR context.

## Schema-first grandfather sunset — the architectural improvement

Closed the asymmetry where Rule 48 protected today's prose but left yesterday's prose grandfathered forever. The grandfather list is **still closed to new additions**, but every existing entry now declares a `sunset_date` (format `YYYY-MM-DD`). Gate Rule 60 fails closed once today's date exceeds any entry's sunset_date without retrofit. Advancing a sunset forward requires an ADR cited inline.

Default sunset schedule encoded in `gate/schema-first-grandfathered.txt`:
- `2026-09-30` — 7 entries whose retrofit lands with W3 contract-design sprint
- `2026-12-31` — 1 entry (RunScope) tied to W4 planner toolset
- `2027-12-31` — 2 entries (RunStatus DFA, IdempotencyRecord) whose authoritative form is already a Java enum + schema-layer CHECK constraint; prose is documentation cross-reference

## Updated counts (rolled into single canonical baseline, kept for historical context)

The Phase 7 addendum originally published a separate "Updated counts" table to record the deltas from the Phase 7 audit. The v2.0.0-rc1 post-release response (§P1-1) consolidates all baselines into the top table of this release note. The pre-audit → post-audit → post-rc1 evolution lives in the post-release response document referenced above. This addendum block remains as historical narrative; the canonical numbers are above.

## L0 release readiness — checklist

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| All HARD audit findings resolved | ✓ D1 (ADR-0076 enforcer fix) + L-1 (Rule 44 code fix) both landed and verified |
| Every `shipped: true` capability has real test evidence | ✓ Gate Rule 19 (`shipped_row_tests_evidence`) PASS |
| Every enforcer row's `artifact:` path resolves on disk | ✓ Gate Rule 28j (`enforcer_artifact_paths_exist`) PASS |
| Architecture-graph regenerates byte-identically | ✓ Gate Rule `architecture_graph_idempotent` PASS; `python gate/build_architecture_graph.py` produces same SHA on consecutive runs |
| Plan §11 enforcer table ↔ enforcers.yaml IDs aligned | ✓ Gate Rule 28i sync verified: 89 IDs match bidirectionally |
| Schema-first invariant (Rule 48) gate-enforced | ✓ Gate Rule 60 PASS; 4 self-tests cover pos / neg / sunset_expired / sunset_malformed |
| All four competitive pillars mentioned in release note | ✓ Section "Four Competitive Pillars" above + addendum baseline counts |
| All `agent-runtime` tests GREEN | ✓ `./mvnw -pl agent-runtime test` → 143 tests, 0 failures (incl. EngineMismatchTransitionsRunToFailedIT) |
| All `agent-platform` tests GREEN | ✓ `./mvnw -pl agent-platform -am test` → 65 tests, 0 failures |
| No open Rule 9 ship-blocking findings | ✓ Self-audit categories (model/LLM, run lifecycle, HTTP/API contract, security, resource lifetime, observability) — no open items |
| Defect family containment verified | ✓ F1 text-drift (Rule 33/34/48 + sunset); F2 envelope-propagation (Phase 3a Matrix + freeze E89); F3 posture (unchanged, still contained); F4 module deps (unchanged); F5 deferred honesty (5 new entries with triggers); F6 enforcer-truth (E88/E89 added) |

## What remains explicitly deferred (not blockers)

- **44.b** Run.engineType field persistence (W2; trigger: third engine type ships or Run.mode breaks 1:1 proxy)
- **44.c** Parent-Run propagation on child failure (W2 async orchestrator)
- **46.b** ResilienceContract s2c.client.callback wiring (W2; trigger: production S2C with > 1 client)
- **48.b** W3 prose-enum retrofit schedule (default trigger 2026-09-30 per grandfather sunset dates)
- **48.c** EngineEnvelope strict-construction validation (W2; trigger: first EngineEnvelope built outside Spring-boot test harness)

Every deferred entry carries an explicit re-introduction trigger per Rule 28 (Code-as-Contract) doctrine.

## Verification commands (full audit reproduction)

bash gate/check_architecture_sync.sh                     # PASS (60 rules)
./mvnw -pl agent-runtime test                            # 143 / 0
./mvnw -pl agent-platform -am test                       # 65 / 0
```

## Conclusion (Historical — rc2 supersession)

The W2.x Engine Contract Structural Wave — including the Phase 7 audit response landed in this addendum — closes the structural coupling between (a) ARCHITECTURE.md prose, (b) CLAUDE.md L0/L1 rules, (c) ADR-0001..0077 decisions, and (d) the Java SPI surfaces under `agent-runtime/`. Every active normative claim is either enforced by a real artefact whose existence the gate verifies, or registered in `CLAUDE-deferred.md` with an explicit re-introduction trigger.

**Historical Phase 7 conclusion:** the corpus was declared L0-release-ready and the recommended tag was `v2.0.0-w2x-final` (retracted).

**Canonical v2.0.0-rc2 conclusion:** the corpus is L0-release-ready. The recommended canonical tag is **`v2.0.0-rc2`** (the prior `v2.0.0-w2x-final` and the intermediate `v2.0.0-rc1` are both superseded; `v2.0.0-w2x-final` was retracted in `docs/governance/retracted-tags.txt`). See the rc2 response document `docs/reviews/2026-05-17-l0-w2x-rc1-second-pass-review-response.en.md` for the 4-finding closure evidence and category-audit summary.

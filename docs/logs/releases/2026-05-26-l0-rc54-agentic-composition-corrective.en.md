# v2.1.0-rc54 — Agentic Composition Corrective Formal Release

> This formal release note is valid only for frozen candidate commit
> `49de909468784ce159121fcf97f83726fc0bff73` and evidence bundle
> `gate/release-ci-evidence/2026-05-26-l0-rc54-agentic-composition-corrective.evidence.yaml`.

## Release Decision

- Decision: **ship** the rc54 corrective publication for L0 agentic-composition closure.
- Frozen commit: `49de909468784ce159121fcf97f83726fc0bff73`.
- Evidence bundle: `gate/release-ci-evidence/2026-05-26-l0-rc54-agentic-composition-corrective.evidence.yaml`.
- Formal release validator: `bash gate/check_formal_release_transaction.sh --evidence gate/release-ci-evidence/2026-05-26-l0-rc54-agentic-composition-corrective.evidence.yaml`.
- Four-pillar coverage: performance, cost, developer_onboarding, governance.
- Active SPI interfaces: 40 total.
- Architecture graph: 606 nodes / 1112 edges.
- Gate self-tests: 260.
- Maven verification: 461 XML-counted tests from WSL-native `./mvnw -Pquality verify`.
- Recurring defect families: 20.

## Corrective Closure

The rc53 post-closure review is closed by this release:

| Finding | Closure |
|---|---|
| P0-1 `ChatAdvisor` not bound into `AgentDefinition` | `AgentDefinition` now has `List<AdvisorBinding> advisorBindings`, `Agent` exposes `advisorBindings()`, ADR-0128 / ADR-0132 / contracts / quickstart all document name-based advisor binding. |
| P0-2 schema-less advisor envelopes | `AdvisedRequest` and `AdvisedResponse` now carry typed same-package `AdvisedModelRequest` / `AdvisedModelResponse` payloads; `AdvisedModelEnvelopeAdapter` proves lossless translation outside `.spi`. |
| P1-1 streaming advisor hook ordering | ADR-0129, ADR-0132, `chat-advisor.v1.yaml`, `model-streaming.v1.yaml`, and Javadocs all cite `advisor-model-hook-order/v1`. |
| P1-2 planner/skill invariants in comments only | `Plan`, `PlanStep`, `StepBudget`, `PlanningBudget`, and `SkillDefinition` now enforce constructor-owned semantic invariants with focused tests. |
| P2-1 live placeholder token in rc53 closure note | The rc53 note no longer carries the live `TBD` line-count token, and Rule 127 now blocks current-release/current-response placeholder leaks while allowing historical defect-family citations. |

## Classification And Sweep

Before systemic fixes, the findings were classified into two existing
recurring families: `F-agentic-contract-composition-gap` and
`F-placeholder-leaks-into-active-corpus`. No unrecorded problem type was
found, so no new recurring family was added. The classification and the
repository-wide sweep are recorded in
`docs/logs/reviews/2026-05-26-l0-rc54-agentic-composition-corrective-response.en.md`.

The sweep covered agent/advisor binding claims, raw advisor envelopes,
quickstart accessor truth, streaming hook-order claims, planner/skill carrier
invariants, and current release-note placeholder tokens. Latent instances
were fixed in the same wave rather than left as local follow-up notes.

## SPI Purity Decision

rc54 keeps the strict purity interpretation requested for this wave:
new advisor SPI payloads do not import adjacent model SPI carriers or
framework/provider types. Typed same-package carriers define the public
contract, and translation into model SPI types happens in the non-SPI adapter
package.

## Evidence

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Red phase focused tests before implementation | FAIL as expected: missing advisor binding and typed advisor envelope carriers. |
| `./mvnw -pl agent-middleware,agent-execution-engine -am -DskipITs -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false -Dtest=AdvisorSpiCarrierImmutabilityTest,AdvisedModelEnvelopeAdapterTest,SkillDefinitionCarrierInvariantTest,PlannerSpiCarrierImmutabilityTest test` | PASS, 18 tests |
| WSL-native `/tmp` copy: `./mvnw -pl agent-service -am -DskipITs -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false -Dtest=AgentSpiCarrierImmutabilityTest,SpiPurityGeneralizedArchTest test` | PASS, 11 tests |
| WSL-native `/tmp` copy: `./mvnw -Pquality verify` | PASS, 461 XML-counted tests |
| `bash gate/test_architecture_sync_gate.sh` | PASS, 260/260 self-tests |
| `bash gate/build_architecture_graph.sh` | PASS, 606 nodes / 1112 edges |
| `bash gate/check_architecture_sync.sh` | PASS |
| `bash gate/check_formal_release_transaction.sh --evidence gate/release-ci-evidence/2026-05-26-l0-rc54-agentic-composition-corrective.evidence.yaml` | PASS |

## Residuals

- Maven quality verification remains WSL-native-ext4 first. Running the full
  quality profile directly from `/mnt/d` can hit DrvFS metadata/copy behavior,
  so formal evidence uses a WSL-native `/tmp` verification copy while every
  script is still launched from WSL.
- PMD reports contain review-trigger maintainability findings only; Rule 121
  treats those as informational, with no SpotBugs high-confidence or
  Checkstyle hard-style blocker.

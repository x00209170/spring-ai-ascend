## Process

New ADRs are proposed by opening a PR that adds a new file to this directory.
The file must use the MADR 4.0 template (see any existing ADR for reference).
ADR numbers are sequential; never reuse a number.
Superseded ADRs remain in the directory with Status: superseded, linking to the successor.

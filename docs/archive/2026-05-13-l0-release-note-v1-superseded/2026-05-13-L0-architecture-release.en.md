# spring-ai-ascend L0 Architecture Release — 2026-05-13 (v1, SUPERSEDED)

> ⚠️ **SUPERSEDED on 2026-05-13** by `docs/logs/releases/2026-05-13-L0-architecture-release-v2.en.md`. After this v1 was published, the same day landed (a) the Service-Layer Microservice Commitment (ADR-0048, §4 #46) and (b) the Whitepaper-Alignment Remediation (ADRs 0049/0050/0051/0052, §4 #47–#50, Gate Rules 28–29, +5 self-tests), which materially shifted the architecture surface. v1 was amended in-place four times to keep up, contradicting its own "frozen" marker. The release was therefore re-cut as v2 (50 §4 constraints / 52 ADRs / 29 gate rules / 35 self-tests baseline) and re-audited by six parallel reviewer agents. **Do not cite this v1 file as canonical.** Consult `docs/logs/releases/2026-05-13-L0-architecture-release-v2.en.md` and `docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml`. This v1 file is retained under `docs/archive/` for historical traceability per ADR-0043.

> **Historical artifact frozen at SHA 82a1397 (L0 release v1).** Baseline counts in this document (45 §4 constraints / 47 ADRs / 27 gate rules / 30 self-tests) reflect the state at v1 release time and are NOT retroactively updated. Subsequent canonical baseline changes — ADR-0048 (Service-Layer Microservice-Architecture Commitment, post-v1 commit 044bbb0) and the whitepaper-alignment remediation introducing ADR-0049/0050/0051/0052 per `docs/logs/reviews/2026-05-13-whitepaper-alignment-remediation-proposal.en.md` — are captured in the v2 release note and tracked separately via `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4, `docs/adr/`, and `docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml`.

> Status: **L0 architecturally ready** (final entrypoint truth review pass complete)
> Semantic release SHA: 82a1397
> Metadata follow-up SHAs: 776d4e7 (set `latest_semantic_pass_sha` to `82a1397`) + contract-review-response delivery (text-corrections + Gate Rule 26) + final entrypoint truth review delivery (boundary prose split + Gate Rule 27)
> Review cycles: 11 passes (2nd reviewer → post-seventh third-pass → L0 release-note contract review → L0 final entrypoint truth review)
> Released: 2026-05-13

## Executive Summary

The spring-ai-ascend W0 runtime kernel is architecturally ready for L0 release. The architecture went through nine structured review cycles, each one categorizing defects into defined patterns, doing systematic self-audits beyond the reviewer's named symptoms, and landing structural (gate-enforced) prevention mechanisms for each pattern class. The final 4-shape defect model — REF-DRIFT, HISTORY-PARADOX, PERIPHERAL-DRIFT, GATE-PROMISE-GAP — defines the lens any future reviewer should use, and each shape now has a dedicated gate rule that prevents recurrence.

The W0 kernel is intentionally small. W1–W4 capabilities are staged as design contracts (ADRs + architecture-status.yaml deferred rows), not premature implementation. Nothing that is not shipped at W0 is described as shipped.

## Capabilities Shipped at W0

### HTTP Edge (agent-platform)

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `GET /v1/health` | Health probe — no auth required, exempt from tenant/idempotency filters |
| `TenantContextFilter` | Binds `X-Tenant-Id` header to `TenantContextHolder` + MDC `tenant_id`; reads header only at W0 |
| `IdempotencyHeaderFilter` | Validates UUID shape of `Idempotency-Key` on POST/PUT/PATCH; 400 in research/prod on missing key; validation only (no dedup at W0) |
| `WebSecurityConfig` | Permits `GET /v1/health`; requires auth on all other routes |

### Runtime Kernel (agent-runtime)

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Run` entity + DFA | 7 statuses (PENDING, RUNNING, SUSPENDED, SUCCEEDED, FAILED, CANCELLED, EXPIRED); `RunStateMachine` validates every transition |
| `Orchestration` SPI | `Orchestrator`, `GraphExecutor`, `AgentLoopExecutor`, `SuspendSignal`, `Checkpointer`, `ExecutorDefinition`, `RunContext` — pure-Java SPIs (verified by `OrchestrationSpiArchTest`); no framework imports. `RunLifecycle` (cancel/resume/retry) remains design-only for W2 — see ADR-0020 |
| `RunContext` | Interface methods: `runId()`, `tenantId()`, `checkpointer()`, `suspendForChild(parentNodeKey, childMode, childDef, resumePayload)`. Tenant identity is sourced from the runtime context, not from the HTTP ThreadLocal (Rule 21). Posture is **not** carried on `RunContext` at W0; posture is enforced via construction-time `AppPostureGate` calls in in-memory components |
| Dev-posture executors | `SyncOrchestrator`, `SequentialGraphExecutor`, `IterativeAgentLoopExecutor`, `InMemoryRunRegistry`, `InMemoryCheckpointer` |
| `AppPostureGate` | Construction-time posture guard (ADR-0035, Rule 6 single-construction-path). Called by `SyncOrchestrator`, `InMemoryRunRegistry`, `InMemoryCheckpointer` to fail-closed in research/prod when used as in-memory components. Not threaded through every runtime component — only the in-memory ones that require dev-only gating |
| `ResilienceContract` + `YamlResilienceContract` | Posture-aware circuit-breaker and retry configuration |
| Memory SPI scaffold | `GraphMemoryRepository` interface — no adapter ships at W0; Graphiti REST reference lands W1 (ADR-0034) |

### Contract and Guard Layer

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| OpenAPI v1 snapshot | `docs/contracts/openapi-v1.yaml` pinned; `OpenApiContractIT` (via `OpenApiSnapshotComparator`) fails if the pinned snapshot diverges from the live spec at `/v3/api-docs`. `ApiCompatibilityTest` is ArchUnit-only — it enforces SPI purity and module-dependency direction, not the OpenAPI snapshot diff |
| ArchUnit guards | `OrchestrationSpiArchTest`, `MemorySpiArchTest` (SPI-purity: no Spring imports in SPIs); `ApiCompatibilityTest` (no `com.alibaba.cloud.ai.*` imports + agent-platform→agent-runtime dep ban); `TenantPropagationPurityTest` (no HTTP ThreadLocal in runtime) |
| Architecture-sync gate | 27 active rules on PowerShell + bash; covers path existence, version consistency, route exposure, module dep direction, SPI contract truth, wave qualifiers, 4-shape defect patterns, release-note shipped-surface truth, and active-entrypoint baseline truth |

---

## Posture Defaults

Set `APP_POSTURE` environment variable:

| Posture | Behavior |
|---------|---------|
| `dev` (default) | Permissive — in-memory backends allowed; missing config emits WARN, not exception |
| `research` | Fail-closed — required config present or ISE; durable persistence expected |
| `prod` | Fail-closed — same as research; stricter enforcement planned for W2 |

`AppPostureGate.requireDevForInMemoryComponent(name)` is the single construction-time read of `APP_POSTURE` (Rule 6 single-construction-path; ADR-0035). It is called by the three in-memory runtime components that require dev-only gating — `SyncOrchestrator`, `InMemoryRunRegistry`, `InMemoryCheckpointer` — during construction. Posture is **not** threaded through `RunContext` or passed as an argument to every runtime component; only those in-memory ones that must fail-closed in research/prod call the gate.

## Verification at Release

```
Maven:        101 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors — BUILD SUCCESS
Gate (PS):    27/27 rules PASS — GATE: PASS
Gate (bash):  27/27 rules PASS — GATE: PASS
Self-tests:   30/30 PASS
```

All `shipped: true` capability rows in `docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml` have resolvable evidence on disk (validated by Gate Rule 24). The release-note text itself is validated for shipped-surface truth by Gate Rule 26 — `RunLifecycle`, `RunContext.posture()`, `ApiCompatibilityTest`-as-OpenAPI-snapshot, and `AppPostureGate` placement/breadth overclaims are mechanically rejected before commit.

## The 4-Shape Defect Model (+ GATE-SCOPE-GAP)

The first nine review cycles revealed a recurring meta-pattern: each round of central-doc repair left peripheral entry-point drift behind. The third-pass cycle codified this as four defect shapes. The tenth cycle (L0 release-note contract review) surfaced a fifth: **GATE-SCOPE-GAP** — a truth-rule's pattern catalog is exhaustive but its *token catalog* is artifact-specific, so a new artifact class (e.g. `docs/logs/releases/*.md`) entering the active corpus inherits zero instrumentation until a dedicated rule is added. ADR-0046 + Gate Rule 26 close this gap for release notes.

| Shape | Structural prevention | Gate rule |
|-------|-----------------------|-----------|
| **REF-DRIFT** — reference resolves but points to wrong file/wave/non-existent artifact | Every evidence field on a `shipped: true` row validated against disk at gate time | Rule 24 (`shipped_row_evidence_paths_exist`) |
| **HISTORY-PARADOX** — document simultaneously active and historical; body stale | `docs/plans/**` entirely historical; module ARCHITECTURE tables distinguish current vs planned | Archive policy + ADR-0043 |
| **PERIPHERAL-DRIFT** — central canonical file correct; README/Javadoc/sidebar still carries old claim | Case-sensitive scan of SPI Javadoc and active markdown for future-wave impl claims without wave qualifier; widened Rule 16a for W1 tenant-model replacement claims | Rule 25 (`peripheral_wave_qualifier`) + Rule 16 (`http_contract_w1_tenant_and_cancel_consistency`) |
| **GATE-PROMISE-GAP** — ARCHITECTURE/ADR prose promises semantic rule; gate enforces narrow literal | PS `-cmatch` for case-sensitive checks; bash `[[:space:]]` for POSIX portability; cross-platform parity tests; self-test coverage for new/strengthened rules | Rules 16a/19/22/24/25 + 28 self-tests |
| **GATE-SCOPE-GAP** — truth-rule's pattern catalog is right but token catalog doesn't cover a sibling artifact class | Dedicated rule per release artifact: name guards, method-list guards, test-attribution guards, scope-claim guards | Rule 26 (`release_note_shipped_surface_truth`) |

Any future architecture review should audit using these five shapes before declaring a cycle clean.

## Known Limitations

The following are known, intentional, and documented:

- **No production-tier durable storage**: PostgresCheckpointer and RLS policies are W2 (ADR-0021). The W0 dev-posture executors use in-memory state that does not survive restart.
- **`IdempotencyStore` is a stub `@Component`**: validates `Idempotency-Key` header format only; no deduplication at W0 (ADR-0027 — W1 promotion).
- **No runtime GraphMemory adapter**: `spring-ai-ascend-graphmemory-starter` registers no bean at W0; the Graphiti REST reference adapter lands at W1 (ADR-0034).
- **Ops runbooks and Helm chart are skeletons**: not deployment-tested in this release; targeted for W1 hardening.
- **JMH performance baseline document exists**: no captured latency/throughput numbers at W0; W4 cadence.
- **9 ADR filenames lag their current titles**: cosmetic mismatch from early title edits; deferred to a dedicated `git mv` commit.

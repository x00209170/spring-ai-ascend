# Performance Benchmarks -- spring-ai-ascend

> Owner: platform-engineering | Maturity: L0 | Last refreshed: 2026-05-13

## Strategy

Benchmarks are run on every minor version cut (W4+ cadence). The JMH
module under perf/jmh/ provides the harness. Baseline numbers are committed
to perf/baseline-<date>.md after each benchmark run.

## Regression policy

If a benchmark result exceeds 2x the baseline p99 for the same operation,
the PR is blocked until the regression is explained or the baseline is
updated with justification.

## Current state

No captured benchmark numbers yet (W0). Named test classes exist in
`agent-service` (`ConcurrencyLoadIT`, `RunHappyPathIT`; post-Phase-C / ADR-0078 —
pre-Phase-C these were in the `agent-platform` reactor module) as L2 targets for W4.
Baseline file at perf/baseline-2026-05-10.md records this state.
